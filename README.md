# Measuring the Impact of Cell Phone Access on Election Fraud during the 2009 Afghan Presidential Election

This is a final course project by Islom M. Juraev (summer semester 2021).

## Project overview

This project replicates paper by Gonzalez, Robert M. 2021. ["Cell Phone Access and Election Fraud: Evidence from a Spatial Regression Discontinuity Design in Afghanistan."](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/app.20190443) *American Economic Journal: Applied Economics*, 13 (2): 1-51.

Gonzalez (2021) examines the impact of cell phone access on election fraud in his paper. He combines cell phone coverage maps with the location of polling centers during the 2009 Afghan presidential election to pinpoint which centers were exposed to coverage. Results from a spatial regression discontinuity design along the two-dimensional coverage boundary suggest that coverage deters corrupt behavior. Polling centers just inside coverage report a drop in the share of fraudulent votes of 4 percentage points, while the likelihood of a fraudulent station decreases by 8 percentage points. Analyses of the effect of coverage on citizen participation in election monitoring, election-related insurgent violence, and the tribal composition of villages suggest that the observed declines in fraud are likely attributed to cell phone access strengthening social monitoring capacity.
