Section II has 7 tables and 6 figures except appendix materials. I replicate the all tables and figures of Section II by extending and adjusting them. Numbering tables and figures don't follow the numbering order of the original paper. This project highly follows the empirical approach and key findings of the Gonzalez (2021). \n",

    "Research on combating against corrupt behavior shows that cell phone access (internet access) reduces the corrupt cases in all spheres of human activity by improving the transparency and transfering the information to the citizens. However, the speed of development in technology and the impact of technology on combating corruption has not been moving at the same space. Gonzalez (2021) provides an evidence that cell phone access deters corrupt bahvior. To be more precise he investagets the impact of cell phone access on election fraud in 2009 Afghan presedential election by exploiting geographic variations in the exposure of polling centers to cell phone coverage. Author uses spatial regression discontinuity design (RDD) to estimate the causal impact of cell phone access on Afghan Election. RDD compares fraud levels for polling centers whithin a close distance of the two-dimensional boundary formed between coverage and noncoverage areas. Results show that cell phone coverage reduces election fraud. "

    "According to the 2001 Bonn Agreement, Afghan presidential and parliamentary elections were scheduled to be held in 2004. First presidential election was held in 2004 but during the election fraud allegations were observed. After this incident, Electoral Complaints Commission (ECC) was created to investigate fraud-related complaints for the upcoming 2009 Afghan presidential election. ECC created a formal channel for individuals to report electoral complaints. In addition, ECC has power to audit, recount and run off the elections if ECC finds it necessary. Excutive board of ECC consists of 5 members and to improve transparency and guarantee the independence of ECC 3 of them were internationl experts who appointed by the United Nations and 2 of them were Afghan commissioners who selected from the Afghanistan Independent Human Rights Commission and the Supreme Court.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fraud allegations were widespread during the 2009 Afghan election. ECC received more than 3300 complaints which 80 percent of those complaints were recieved during the polling and counting period. According to the type of complaints, 47 percent was about polling and counting irregularities, 26 percent was about intimidation and violance, 11 percent was about the access to the polling station, 4 percent was about missing election materials at the centre and 12 percent about the other types of complaints. Citizen participation in 2009 election shows a better improvment comparing 2004 presidential election due to the formal channel.\n",
    "\n",
    "ECC ordered a nationwide audit of polling stations after investigations of the received complaints revealed clear evidence of widespread fraud. ECC defined six categories (look at the Appendix 1) of auding and recounting the polling stations. However, author combined these six categories into three categories. Criteria of auding and recounting the polling stations were: (i) stations in which 600 or more votes were cast, (ii) stations in which on candidate received 95 percent or more of the total vote cast, and (iii) stations satisfying both (i) and (ii). ECC denoted these categories as Category A, B and C, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "To visualize the election fraud, author uses ***temp_figure_votes.dta*** which consists of 23730 polling stations with 74 variables. The variable ***votes16*** is for total votes received by Hamid Karzai and ***votes9*** is for total votes received by Abdullah Abdullah."

    "The main motivation for these categories lay in the designing of the election. Each polling stations managers were provided with a ballot book containing exactly 600 empty ballots. However, a significant number of polling stations reported totals of exactly 600 or more votes cast. This was unusual given the overall low turnout resulting from expectations around election related violance (Khadhouri 2010). Figure 1 shows the difference in reported turnout by plotting a histogram of total votes cast per station for the top two candidates. Significant jump in the frequency of total votes cast was at exactly 600 for the candidate Hamid Karzai. One more interesting fact is that frequency of total votes cast are available more than 600 which contradicts one of the main design of election."

    "ECC classified 3376 stations or nearly 15 percent of all stations as potentially fraudlent. ECC performed a partial audit of all suspected stations in order to determine whether runoff election is needed or not. To save time and to be less costly ECC randomly selected 10 percent of the qualifying stations for a detailed investigation. ECC created a \"fraud coefficient\" for each of the three categories mentioned above. Fraud coefficients are the percentage of votes to be fraudlent out of the total votes inspected within the category.\n",
    "\n",
    "Two months after election day, ECC released the results of the audit by eliminating the suspected votes from the count. Hamid Karzai's vote share dropped from 54.6 to 49.67 percent, while the vote share of his main opponent, Abdullah Abdullah, went from 27.8 to 30.59 percent. According to the results, ECC ordered an immediate runoff election. However, runoff election did not happen, because the main candidate Abdullah withdrew his candidacy from the race."

    "Gonzalez uses the list of polling stations that were subject to the audit and the ECC fraud categories to define the primary measure of fraud in his paper. As above described author first aggregates six categories used by the ECC to trigger an audit into three broader categories:\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Category A* - stations with 600 or more votes cast\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Category B* - stations in which one candidate received 95 percent or more of the total votes cast, and\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Category C* - stations stations satisfying categories *A* and *B* above (look at the Appendix 1 for detailed explanation).\n",
    "\n",
    "Gonzalez defines two fraud outcomes. The first is *(i) Share of votes under Category C*, i.e., the polling-center- level vote share of stations that were under *Category C*. To be more precise, given a polling center *c* with total of *s* stations of which *n < s* qualify as *category C* and it is the measure of fraud at center *c* is given by the total number of votes in the n suspected stations divided by the total votes cast in center *c*. The second is *(ii) an indicator for whether polling center c has at least one diqualified polling station or station which is qualified as Category C*.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to note that a station qualifies for one of the categories does not necessarily imply that fraud was committed in this station. For instance, some stations may have unusually high voter turnout rates or unusually strong prefrences for one specific candidate. In that case, this measure can be interpreted as a proxy for fraud. These proxies provide a precise signal on actual fraud given the context and design of the election. This type of measure has been previously used in the economics and cross validated with alternative measures of fraud in the same Afghan context (Weidmann and Callen 2013).\n",

    "Cell phones are the main medium of communication in Afghanistan. Author uses Global System for Mobile communications (GSM) second-generation (2G) coverage maps to determine areas with cell phone coverage. This dataset is directly provided by cell phone operators to the GSM Association (GSMA) and distributed by Collins Bartholomew. The coverage maps indicate the areas receiving 2G coverage based on the spatial distribution of cell phone towers across Afghanistan. Specifically, coverage data are in the form of a map raster or grid file indicating cells where signal strength is at least - 100 decibel-milliwatts (dBm). This is *minimum received signal power* in GSM wireless networks, or roughly speaking, the minimum signal strength needed to be able to make a call (Figueiras and Frattasi 2010)."
